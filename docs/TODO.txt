parsing order:
- check quoting parity:
	every open should be matched a close (exit if not)
- replace $xxx by vars if not in single quotes
- split with spaces (except quoted parts):
	could first replace spaces within quoted part by a nums>128, then remove quote pairs, then split		then reintroduce spaces?
